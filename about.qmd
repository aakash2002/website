Hey! I'm Aakash a 4th year doing a specialist in Computer Science and Minor in Statistics. Currently debating whether I should do a Major in Statistics or not.

I'm interested in potentially pursuing research in the field of Reinforcement Learning and am excited to learn more about it.

Outside of work, I like to go to the gym, cook and play badminton. I'm trying to get back into running and wish to oneday run a marathon.
